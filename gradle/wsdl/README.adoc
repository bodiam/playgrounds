= WSDL

Auxiliary module to manage, document and pack used SOAP services definitions.

Note that this is a generic, language-agnostic project (another feature that Gradle offers).
It is used only to demonstrate custom configurations / inter-project dependencies.
In a real world a ZIP (JAR) with WSDLs most probably will come from a Maven repository.
